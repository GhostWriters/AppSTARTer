### What is AppSTARTer?

AppSTARTer is a new script from GhostWriters!

The main goal of AppSTARTer is to make it quick and easy to get up and running with natively installed applications.

You may choose to rely on AppSTARTer for various changes to your system's native installs, or use AppSTARTer as a stepping stone and learn to do more advanced configurations.

Currently, AppSTARTer will install the applications but doesn't do any configuration changes, like ports. Everything is currently installed with default values, but that will change over time.
